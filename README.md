# Categorical-regression-analysis-2022-HSE
In this repository, I have put together my homework on regression analysis of categorical data - the course of the HSE Faculty of Economics in 2022

* *Homework 1* was about basic logistic regression models
* *Homework 2* was about basic multinomial regression models
* *Homework 3* was an essay on the *differences in the effects of human capital for individuals with different income levels using the example of a study of Spanish households in 2020*. In the proposed work, we have shown that an increase in the level of education really
reduces the likelihood of being in the lower-income category, which confirms
the general theoretical assumptions of the theory of human capital and
is consistent with the assumption of a positive return on education. The model
showed that education is one of the most important factors in
clarifying income level dispersion, more important than standard control
factors for models explaining inequality.
Nevertheless, our model has faced a number of problems: it is unsatisfactory-
predicts the results for individuals with the lowest income. Data and .tex are attached
